The newest estimates.
These one were obtained with taking advantage of derivative of distribution function and smoothing.

Lesser quality threshold and and lack of smoothing gives underestimated length of genome.




It was really long task.
Results with quality threshold at 20.
Estimated genome length is 880034534.862069 taken that putative maximum is 116.
Looking at plot it looks wrong and I would rather take something about 190. Hence estimate of genome length will be reduced to 537284242.3728.
Repetitive peaks after main perhaps reflect repeats.

Results with no quality constraints.
You can see that x axis on original plot is much wider - up to 500k. It means that some 11-mers have frequency around 500k, probably due to noise in data. 
Estimated genome length was 3164991322.671875 with putative maximum at 128. 
Length in case with lower appropriate quality is bigger than in calculations with quality threshold.
